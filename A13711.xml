            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Teach vs, O Lord, to number, &amp;c.</hi>] This text may wel be tearmed the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> his Arithmetike, a better Arithmetike than our ſchoole humanitians, and profeſſours of Arithmetike in Vniuerſities are wont to teach.</p>
            <p>This croſſeth and vtterly confuteth the courſe of the vain men of this world: for they giue themſelues to calculate other matters.</p>
            <p>The Marchant numbreth his debts, the Vſurer his money, the Lawyer his clyents, the Husbandman his goods and cattells, the Captaine his ſouldiers: but <hi>Dauid</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, knew well the vanity of the one, and the neceſſity of this other; and better Arithmetike.</p>
            <p>He deſireth God to teach him to number, not his wealth, nor his riches, nor his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor his treſures, nor his pleaſures, but his daies. <hi>Teach me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to number my daies.</hi> We reade of <hi>Nabucad-nezzar</hi> a King, ſo he was like <hi>Dauid:</hi> but he had not learned to number his daies, ſo he was vnlike <hi>Dauid.</hi> This prowd king walking and ſtrowting in <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note> his royal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>allace at Babel, was numbering the towres thereof, and was numbering his wealth, and his magnificence, and power. <hi>Is not this great Babel, is not this my kingdom. &amp;c?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11763:6"/> This Arithmetike made <hi>Nabucad-nezzar</hi> prowd, and made him forget God that gaue him that power, and that honour, and that monarchie.</p>
            <p>But this Arithmetik of <hi>Dauids</hi> taught him humilitie, and meekneſſe, and keepeth him ſo far from forgetfulneſſe of God, that he rather forgets himſelfe, and his kingly titles, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for in this pſalme, but eſpecially in this verſe he diſclaimes, as it were, from al his regal authoritie, power, and ſtate, and exhibites himſelfe a perfect paterne of humilitie.</p>
            <p>Though he were Gods anointed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted with great maieſtie, and honor, yet he forgat not his pedigree, but hath regiſtred the ſame to all poſterities, in that he ſaith: thou tookeſt <hi>Dauid</hi> when he followed the Ewes great with yong, and annointedſt him to be <note place="margin">Pſa. 78. 70.</note> Prince ouer thy people, of a ſheepheard crowning him a King.</p>
            <p>And though he were a King of the earth, yet hee knew hee was but a King of earth, a man of the ſame mowld that others are of, and ſubiect to the ſame corruption: nay him <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 6</note> ſelfe in another place, calles himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lfe, a worm and no man.</p>
            <p>And as he could teach himſelfe a leſſon of mortalitie, ſo could he teach it others alſo:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11763:6"/> ſpeaking to magiſtrates, he ſaith thus; I haue ſaid, ye are Gods, but ye ſhal al die like men: and that Princes ſhould not ſcape vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, <note place="margin">Pſalme 82</note> he a Prince telleth Princes, that they ſhould alſo die like others.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſince Princes, and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and people, and all muſt die, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God for himſelf and others: ſaying. <hi>Teach vs; O Lord, to number our daies.</hi>] Wee finde <note place="margin">1. Chro. 21</note> this prophet numbering, but not his daies, as in this place, but there he numbered his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he would needs know his ſtrength, and power, and the number of his people; but himſelf &amp; all Iſrael ſmarted for that folly: and himſelfe being brought to the knowledge of his ſin, confeſſed he had done very fooliſhly. And therefore now hee workes more wiſely, he prayeth God to teach him to number his daies: here he takes in hand another kinde of numeration.</p>
            <p>The prophet ſheweth, that except the Lord <note place="margin">Pſa. 127</note> buyld the houſe, they that buyld it, labor but in vaine: and except the Lord keepe the citie the keeper waketh but in vaine.</p>
            <p>There hee prooueth that in buylding it is God alone who is the * <hi>Architectus,</hi> both to lay the foundation, and the roofe too.</p>
            <p>In keeping of the cittie hee is the onely
<pb facs="tcp:11763:7"/> watchman of Iſrael, that neuer ſlumbereth.</p>
            <p>And here he proueth another propertie to be in God, which is, that he in teaching, is the only ſchoolemaſter, or doctour, verifying that in the 15. of <hi>Iohn</hi> his Goſpel, without me ye can do nothing: he is al in al, a ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all, both learned, and vnlearned, euen to teach princes knowledge, and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wiſedome.</p>
            <p>This leſſon muſt needes be well learned, that proceeds from ſuch a teacher: in the 86 and 119. Pſalmes he prayeth the Lorde to teach him the way of his ſtatutes: and here he prayeth God to teach him another thing: to to number his daies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhewes he was no truaunt in the ſchoole of Chriſt, but hauing learned one leſſon, he couets to learne another, and ſtill calles vpon God, like a good ſcholler vpon his maſter, O teach me thy teſtimonies: teach <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 33.</note> me thy ſtatutes, teach me thy waies, teach me to number my daies.</p>
            <p>All that will be ſchollers in the ſchoole of Chriſt imitate <hi>Dauid:</hi> couet to learne more &amp; <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> more, that you may bring forth much fruite.</p>
            <p>If you haue alreadie learned your rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, your Alphabet of religion, labour yet further, to come to the depth of diuinitie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11763:7"/> like the Prophet <hi>Ezech:</hi> who when hee had waded in the waters about the ſanctuarie, he waded deeper and deeper, firſt to the ankles, <note place="margin">Ezech. 47.</note> then to the knees, then to the loynes, till hee could paſſe no further.</p>
            <p>We are firſt children, and then we ſuck the <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2.</note> milke of the woord: afterwards we become men, and then wee muſt diſgeſt ſtronger meate.</p>
            <p>We muſt be ſo wel ſchooled, that we may be able to anſwere euery man, that ſhall aske vs a reaſon of the hope that is in vs.</p>
            <p>So well ſchooled, that we may be able to teach others, as <hi>Peter</hi> being ſtrengthned did <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> ſtrengthen the brethren, and as <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> who thogh ſhe were a woman, was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding able to inſtruct <hi>Apollos</hi> an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>This ſhort leſſon of <hi>Dauid</hi> miniſtreth this inſtruction to vs, it teacheth vs, whom we ſhuld pray vnto, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhould intreate for a ſupplie in our wants, he teacheth vs to flie vnto God onely, for in him dwelleth all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:11763:8"/> Noah, Moſes,</hi> all the Patriarches, and Prophets, Martyrs, and Confeſſors before him, yet he had learned to inuocate none, to pray to none but God only: there he taught, and here againe he teacheth, that God alone muſt be ſought vnto, none but he implored. None can teach vs but God, &amp; therefore we muſt ſubmit our ſelues to be taught onely by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teach vs, O Lord, to number &amp;c.] Eue</hi> our progenetrix had learned one leſſon from God, at the deliuering of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <note place="margin">Gene. 2. 16</note> wherein it was charged, that they ſhoulde not eate of the forbidden tree. But ſhee was not contented with one, but would faine haue choice of teachers, like a truanting ſcholler that ſtill changeth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: <note place="margin">Geneſ. 3. 4.</note> and therfore ſhe learned a ſecond leſſon from the diuel. He taught hir, that they ſhuld not die, but ſhould liue like Gods, knowing good and euil: but <hi>Eue</hi> found him a lying teacher, for they became diuells, and death was ſentenced againſt them and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, becauſe they forſooke their firſt teacher.</p>
            <p>Many now a daies, ſpecially the conceated wiſe, wil not offer themſelues, to be taught of God, but they will teach themſelues, and learne of themſelues, they will flie to their

               <hi>Saul</hi> was neuer forſaken ſo long as hee counſailed with God, but when hee choſe a <note place="margin">1.

            <p>In the firſt Chapter of the ſecond booke of <hi>Chronicles</hi> we find <hi>Salomon</hi> the ſon asking of God wiſedome: and here we find <hi>Dauid</hi> the father asking of God wiſedome alſo.</p>
            <p>A good father chawlkes the waie firſt, and as gracious a ſonne that well might ſeeme to deſcend from ſo good a father, followes the ſame path after, both walking towards God, a father to them both, both of one affection do aske one &amp; the ſame thing, viz. wiſedom, but reſpecting a diuers end; the one, to thend he might the better gouerne his people; the other, to be able thereby to number his days.</p>
            <p>And this much ſhal briefly ſuffice for the cleering of the firſt note, which teacheth you if you will learne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to pray vnto God for knowledge; deſire him to direct you, and teach you; as to teach you al things, ſo princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally this: pray him to learne you to number your daies.</p>

               <hi>To number.</hi>] It is aſcribed vnto God by <hi>Daniel,</hi> that God alone numbreth, weigheth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11763:9"/> and diuideth, he meaſureth times &amp; ſeaſons, daies, &amp; yeares, and he that is the numberer, will teach vs to number, if we wil offer our ſelues to be taught by him.</p>
            <p>No leſſon is more neceſſary for theſe times conſidering how ſinne hath ſpread it ſelfe, like a leprozie ouer all fleſh: and iniquitie hath gotten the vpperhand. And more then this, the vialls of Gods wrath are powred our alreadie vpon vs, to conſume vs, as we are all eie-witneſſes this day. Al had bin preuented, if we had bin carefull, to get vnto our ſelues this one comfortatiue, more worth than all the balme in Gilead, to haue knowledge to number our daies.</p>
            <p>From the firſt words of this pſalme to this preſent text, now handled, the prophet reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulateth, and recounteth the ſhortnes, and miſerie of this life, and in the tenth verſe, he makes vp a calender as it were of mans age, in that he ſaith the life of man is threeſcore <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.</note> yeares and ten, and though men be ſo ſtrong that they come to foureſcore yeares, yet is their time then but labor and ſorrow, ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone.</p>
            <p>The note raiſed hence muſt be this, the ſhortnes of time ought to make vs more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect: and certainly if men did in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

            <p>
               <hi>Fabian</hi> a ſenator was choaked with an haire, Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> with a flie: if <hi>Iacob</hi> counted his time but ſhort, hauing alreadie liued an hundred and thirtie yeares, what reckoning may wee make of our time which is farre ſhorter?</p>
            <p>In the time afore the floud, the age of man was great: <hi>Adam</hi> liued 930. yeares, <hi>Noah</hi>

            <p>But after the floud in <hi>Terah</hi> his daies, who was father to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the age of man was a great deale ſhortned from 900. it was brought down to two hundred, and vnder.</p>

            <p>To draw to a concluſion, life it ſelfe is but an harbenger of death, and we liue to die.

So is it verified which was ſpoken by our Sauior Chriſt, in the 5. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> happie <note place="margin">Mat. 54.</note> are ye that mourne, for ye ſhall reioyce.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11763:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Peters</hi> mourning is turned to mirth, his ſadneſſe to ſolace, his pain to pleaſure, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting to reioycing, for Chriſt hath wiped away al teares from his eies, becauſe with him the firſt things are paſt alreadie, and now he is crowned with glorie like the Angells.</p>
            <p>And this he hath now in heauen, becauſe God loued him walking a good diſciple here on earth, ſhewing himſelfe to be indeede, what he was in name, videlicet <hi>Simon</hi> an obedient hearer.</p>
            <p>He is alſo called <hi>Peter,</hi> videlicet confident and ſtrong in faith, like a rocke inuincible.</p>
            <p>And in this place we find him penitent, his obedience is teſtified in the hiſtorie of his life, for at Chriſt his commandement he for ſooke his calling, and became his diſciple: his ſtrength of faith our Sauior himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, where he ſaith vpon his confeſſion of him; Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon this rock will <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> I build my congregation.</p>
            <p>He was penitent, the words nowe read vnto you doproue the ſame: for after he had ſinned, he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>O that euery Chriſtian man were thus qualified like <hi>Peter!</hi> theſe three graces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce faith. and obedience, are better welcome vnto God, than the three preſents <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 11.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:11763:15"/> giuen by the wiſemen vnto Chriſt, golde, frankenſence and mirrh, are not ſo precious.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the embowelling of theſe wordes nowe read vnto you, I muſt firſt acquaint you with the ſubſtance of that which went afore my text, being the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words now to be handled. When Chriſt was about his paſſion, and euen now was readie to be offered vp vnto his father, for the ſealing vp of our redemption, being vnder the handes of the ciuill magiſtrate, to be either condemned or acquited, the text ſaith, <hi>Peter</hi> ſtoode a farre off, to ſee the end, as the fiftie eight verſe witneſſeth, there we reade that he came into the high prieſts hal, and there ſate downe with the ſeruants, to ſee what would become of Ieſus.</p>
            <p>And while he ſate there, the hiſtory noteth, that a maid came vnto him, &amp; chalenged him to be one of Ieſus diſciples: alſo waſt (ſaith ſhe) with Ieſus of Galile, Reade the 69 verſe, and ſo forwards, but he denied, and ſaid, I wot not what thou ſaiſt: the ſecond maide came, and charged him in like maner, and then he ſwore, he knew not Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Being the third time charged by the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, he began to curſe and ſweare that he knew not the man: ſuch is our corruption,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11763:15"/> and Satans pollicie in tempting vs, when we fall once, we fall againe and againe, like <hi>Peter,</hi> who hauing denied Chriſt once, made no bones of it, to denie him the ſecond and third time.</p>
            <p>Marke the degrees of <hi>Peter</hi> his ſinne: firſt he denied him ſimply, without any oath, as one not greatly regarding what the maid ſaid vnto him, I wot not what thou ſaieſt: but the ſecond time he rapt out an oath, he know not the man: and the third time he proceeded to curſe and ſweare.</p>
            <p>A bare oath would not ſerue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he curſt himſelfe too: he was become ſo cunning and ſo prompt a ſwearer, as if he had made an occupation of it all his life before.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as he had learned to lie, he had learned to ſweare, for lying, and ſwearing, are partners, like a theefe &amp; a receiuer, inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companions, and as I may ſay, ſworne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brethren, that alwaies iumpe together in a ſinful ſocietie.</p>
            <p>And hauing learned to lie and ſweare, he had learned at once to curſe too: curſing came in like a ſixt finger, to make vp the meſſe, when the table was ful already.</p>
            <p>Wee neuer reade of <hi>Peters</hi> ſwearing any where elſe, yet here vpon a ſodaine, oaths and

            <p>This was <hi>Peters</hi> fall: but we are to ſpeake of <hi>Peters</hi> riſing, and of <hi>Peters</hi> repentance, for ſo ſoone as he was wakened with the alarum of a ſeely cocke, he began to remember his ſin, &amp; to weigh the greatnes of it: for ſo <hi>Mark</hi> recordeth of him, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the words of Ieſus, and weighing that with himſelfe, he went out and wept: our text ſaith he went out and wept bitterly.</p>

               <p>Becauſe Chriſt came to fulfill the lawe, therefore he firſt ate the Paſſeouer, with his Diſciples, and ſo finiſhed that, &amp; abrogated it, in ſteede whereof, he preſeutly for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>In the time of trouble and heauines, when wee combat with the diuel, and our owne fleſh, comfort ſeemes for a time to be hid, like fire that is raked vp in the aſhes, vntil the bellowes of Gods prouidence blowe vpon it, and then it ſhewes it ſelfe vpon a ſodaine,

            <p>The belly will tempt vs to incredulitie, and diſtruſtfulneſſe, as it tempted that Prince, on whoſe ſhoulder the King leaned, <note place="margin">2.

            <p>Let this Prince be a preſident of terror, to all vnbeleuing wretches, that will diſtruſt the diuine prouidence.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould we diſtruſt God, ſince we know that he careth for ſparrowes: and how much better are we than many ſparowes?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 39, 3.</note> Yea he feedeth the rauens, that cry vnto him, and himſelf chargeth vs, not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our bodies, what raiment we ſhall put on, nor for our bellies what meate we ſhall prouide; for after all theſe things do the <note place="margin">Mat. 6, 25.</note> Gentiles ſeeke.</p>

            <p>And therefore why are ye carefull, O ye of little faith?</p>
            <p>The belly made the Iſraelites diſtruſt God in the wildernes, when they murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and wiſhed themſelues among the fleſh pots in Aegypt, for there ſay they, wee ate <note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> bread our bellies full, but now we muſt die with famine: they would not rely vpon God, longer than he fed them with bread from heauen, or gaue them water out of the hard rocke.</p>

            <p>God requireth that his children do waite his leiſure: for he ſtaieth and reſtrayneth his bleſſings from vs, for a ſeaſon; becauſe our faith and our pacience may be ſounded.</p>
            <p>It is no maruaile if their faith ſtand ſure, who liue at eaſe, and are not humbled with any croſſe of affliction, that haue all their heart can deſire; that haue long life, like <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſalah,</hi> great ſtore of wealth like <hi>Salomon:</hi> honor like <hi>Haman:</hi> lands, and poſſeſſions, like the rich yong man in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Theſe were neuer driuen to the deſart: but let God lay his hand vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; take from them all that euer they haue, returning them to the world, as naked as <hi>Iob;</hi> let him take away, firſt their children, after that their goods, then touch them in their bodies with ſickneſſe, and it will appeare whether they haue faith or not, and that conſtancy, that was in <hi>Iob,</hi> who after al his loſſes, yea his own wife ſtanding at his elbow, tempting him to curſe God, yet could ſay, ſhall we receiue good at the hands of God, and not euill? <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 10</note>
            </p>
            <p>I rather ſuppoſe, that a great ſort beeing tempted with the loſſe of goods, or any ſuch like triall, would rather ſhrinke away from God like <hi>Demas,</hi> or like the accuſers that ranne from Chriſt: or like the young rich

            <p>
               <hi>And when he had faſted fortie dayes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights, &amp;c</hi>] Here is ſet downe the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous abſtinence in faſting fortie dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meate, which is not therefore pende to the end we ſhould imitate the ſame, for our indeuour would faile in the attempting of it: for who is able to faſt forty daies, without receiuing any nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but it is rather ſet down for our comfort, &amp; the ſtrengthning of our faith, which is the end and ſcope of al his other miracles. Howſoeuer our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the Papiſts haue in a ſuperſtitious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitednes ſuppoſed, that our faſt of fortie daies in the lent time vſually holden, hath his warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from this faſt of Chriſt in the deſart.</p>
            <p>But they are vtterly deceiued, and this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb facs="tcp:11763:48"/> of theirs hath not any ſhadowe of truth or probabilitie.</p>
            <p>Chriſt rather in this ſheweth the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and conſent betweene the newe and old teſtament, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſeruant of God receiuing the lawe on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> did faſt fortie daies without meate, ſo would Chriſt faſt ſo many daies, bringing to vs the newe law, viz. the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>This faſt then of fortie daies which wee celebrate, hath not his ground from hence, but it is a meere ordinance of man, and if it be not obſerued as it ought in his true vſe, <hi>viz.</hi> being taken onely for a ciuill ordinance, profitable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and increaſing of that, which otherwiſe would be extraordinarily conſumed, it will carry with it matter, rather of fooliſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, then of any ſincere deuout religion.</p>
            <p>Further, if it had been expedient for vs to haue imitated this faſt of fortie daies, Chriſt would haue in his Goſpel commaunded it, but we finde no ſuch commandement, nor can any probable collection be drawen out of ſcripture to induce vs hereunto, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is rather a ceremonious faſt, then a true faſt, not being rightly celebrated.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites had as great reaſon to haue
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11763:48"/> ſtabliſhed a like faſt to that of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount, as we to ſtabliſh ours nowe by the example of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The time of faſting is to be determined by the church, according to the occaſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will ſauour of ſuperſtition. That is it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> reprooues in the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Dies obſeruatis,</hi> ye obſerue daies &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and yeares, I am in feare of you. Wee may not therefore preſcribe times and faſtes at our owne pleaſure, but when the church ſhall ſo appoynt, vpon ſpeciall occaſion.</p>
            <p>And this hath euer beene the order of the primitiue church, to appoynt times of faſts, at ſuch times as they felt the hande of Gods Iudgement againſt them for ſinne, or any imminent perill, then they would giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to prayer &amp; faſting, being therunto admoniſhed by the paſtors or miniſters.</p>
            <p>Further, our aduerſaries haue erred in this, they vſe this faſt, as purpoſing to merit hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thereby, wherin they miſſe the true end of faſting, which is not to merit or obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſins therby, but to make vs the more apt to ſerue God in praier, by taming our bodies, as the apoſtle noteth, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelues, and by the exerciſing of all good works.
<pb facs="tcp:11763:49"/> yet further to make the beſt of it, if they haue ordained it as a meane to chaſten the bodie, yet becauſe they haue not left it free for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to vndergo the ſame voluntarily, but do by violence as it were, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſaide faſt, it cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>I omit to ſpeak of the great loſſes, harmes, and inconueniences proceeding from ſuch faſts.</p>
            <p>Howe many haue miſcarried in that long time of abſtinence, eſpecially the aged and ſicke, and weake, and women great with child.</p>
            <p>Let no man miſtake me, for I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne faſting, I condemne the abuſes of it, as we may ſinne in the beſt action that wee take in hand, we rather commend it in all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, as a moſt neceſſarie chriſtian exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and not for certaine daies only, but euen throughout our whole liues, if poſſibly wee might performe the ſame.</p>
            <p>It may then be here demanded, why doth the Prince command this Lent faſt. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: Poſitiue lawes made by Princes, for the conſeruation of the pollicie, not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the lawes of God, ought of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects with reuerence of the magiſtrate to be obaied, not onely for feare of puniſhment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11763:49"/> but for conſcience. Conſcience, I ſay, not of the thing, which of it owne nature is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but of our obedience, which by the law of God we owe to the magiſtrate, as vnto Gods miniſter; by which poſitiue lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſubiects be reſtrained for certain daies, from ſome kind of meates, which God in his word, hath left free to be taken, &amp; vſed with thankſgiuing at all times, yet becauſe ſuch lawes of Princes are not made to put holineſſe in one kind of meate or other, or to make one day more holy then another, but are grounded meerely vppon pollicie, all ſubiects are bound to obey the ſame; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Paul</hi> his precept: <hi>Omnis anima ſuperioribus poteſtatibus ſubiecta est:</hi> let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the ſuperior powers.</p>
            <p>Another doubt ariſeth hence, whether we <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1</note> may in faſting withhold from our bodies all meate and drink, or not, during the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined time of faſting, or whether by faſting is meant, to vſe a temperate kind of diet, a more ſober diet than we were wont.</p>
            <p>There are great variety of opinions in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Some thinke they faſt wel, if they abſtaine only from fleſh and fiſh, ſome do only feede at that time vpon fiſh, and others eate of all

            <p>Some eate neither hearbes nor egges: ſome receiue nothing but drie bread, ſome abſtaine all the day vntill night, &amp; then they eate without difference.</p>
            <p>Here we haue neede of a skilfull <hi>Pilot,</hi> to direct vs in our compaſſe. It appeareth by many teſtimonies of ſcripture, that a true faſt conſiſteth in a generall abſtinence from all kindes of meates for the time.</p>
            <p>If men ſhall be truly humbled vnder the burthen of ſinne, and ſhall feele the wrath of God vppon them for their ſinnes, when they ſhall conſidder of the rewarde of ſinne, and of the paines of hell. I ſay, this being ſeriouſly done, their minds being occupied, partly with feare and terror; partly with a deſire to be deliuered from the guilt of ſinne, and the wrath of God, ſuing and intreating in all humilitie vnto God for pardon, all luſt of meate will be laid apart.</p>
            <p>Then nothing pleaſeth vs more then to mourne, and to weepe out before the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2.

            <p>Chriſt himſelfe giues a ful ſolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide <note place="margin">Luke. 5, 33.</note> this doubt, in that his anſwere made to the Pharaſies, when they demanded of him why his Diſciples faſted not? his anſwer was this: can ye make the children of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chamber faſt, as long as the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome is with them?</p>
            <p>Like a good maiſter, he defendeth the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of his ſchollers, and proueth them not to be guilty of tranſgreſſion, though they faſted not, and withal, reproueth the Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of ſuperſtition, and ignorance; of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb facs="tcp:11763:52"/> becauſe they put a religion in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workes, of aſcribing holineſſe to the meere action, not reſpecting the end of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: of ignorance alſo, becauſe they could not diſcerne betweene time and time.</p>
            <p>But by this anſwer it appeares they did not faſt, for Chriſt graunts it.</p>
            <p>Faſting then by theſe teſtimonies afore alleaged, and by Chriſt his owne aſſent, is the withholding of all naturall foode, for the determined time of faſting.</p>

            <p>The woord of God muſt ſuſtaine vs by faith, as it doth all the godly.

            <p>If thou call vpon God this day, and hee heareth thee not, call againe to morrow, and the third day, day after day, till he heare thee, like the Iſraelites, when they fought againſt their brethren the Beniamites: though it go hard with thee for many daies, and manie yeares, yet be ſure that ere long the yeare of Iubilee will come, and ſet all the children of God at libertie.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour in this place had now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fortie daies without meate, and yet hee faſteth, and the diuell tempteth, and his belly aketh, &amp; his ſtomacke hungreth, and Chriſt is ſtill the ſame, both before his faſt, and in

            <p>Let Chriſt teach vs patience, to indure al croſſes and temptations.</p>
            <p>Make Patience thy Porter, and thou ſhalt be ſtrong inough to carrie all burthens.</p>
            <p>This patience is like the hearty ſpies, that <note place="margin">Num. 13</note> retourning from <hi>Canaan,</hi> toulde their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, tis nothing to ouercome them: ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed with patience when thou buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt with affliction or pouertie, hunger, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſſe ſoeuer thou canſt, ſay, it is nothing to ouercome them.</p>
            <p>So the Godly haue taken courage to themſelues, and in the very brunt of their toubles, they haue learned to triumph with <hi>Paul,</hi> in this we are more than conquerers: <hi>Daniel</hi> waiteth ſix daies in the lions den, and at length came <hi>Abacucke,</hi> that neuer before knew Babilon, with an harueſt dinner vnto him.</p>
            <p>So, whether after ſix daies, or after xl. days ſooner, or later, God will ſuccor thee, only be pacient, &amp; thinke it not long: for though it be an old ſaying, it is a true ſaying, <hi>mans extremitie, is Gods oportunitie.</hi>

            <p>One thing is neceſſary, which is the word of God, and whoſoeuer ſhall feede his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoule therewith, ſhall receiue full and perfect nouriſhment, and ſhall be able to continue longer in the ſtrength thereof, than <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount.</p>
            <p>This is beetter then <hi>Manna,</hi> that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Iſraelites in the wildernes, for they are dead, but this is the liuing bread that <note place="margin">10. 6.</note> came from heauen, and this feedes vs vp to eternall life.</p>
            <p>This word is Chriſt his ſword, and it hath two edges, to cut both waies, and with this ſword doth he incounter with Satan, and conquer him.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are borowed from the eight of <hi>Deuter onomie,</hi> where the Lord ſpeaketh
<pb facs="tcp:11763:58"/> thus to the Iſraelites: the Lord God hath humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and hath giuen thee <hi>Manna</hi> to eate, neuer knowne to thy fathers, to the end he might teach thee, that man liueth not by bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by euery word proceeding out of the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>As if he ſhould haue ſaid, becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thee to hunger, and yet ſuffered thee not to periſh, thou mightſt hence eaſily haue learned, that it is God only who ſuſtaineth thee with his word without bread.</p>
            <p>That this doctrine is true, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible teſtimonies of the woord, your owne experience can witneſſe; for if we liued by bread onely, it were neceſſary that we ſhould be continually, and at all times filled there with: but it is indeede the woord that feedes vs, and the bleſſing of God lapt vp in the word that giues vs ſtrength, &amp; makes vs able to receiue the good creatures of God, I meane bread, and drinke, and ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary foode, who alſo maketh our meate ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to be nutritiue to our bodies.</p>
            <p>When we are healthie and ſtrong, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receiue our daily ſuſtenance, why then we muſt acknowledge that this ſtrength proceedes from God. If contrarily we be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11763:58"/> ſicke, and weake, and can neither receiue our foode, nor diſgeſt it: after we haue taken it, then we muſt know that God hath taken our ſtrength from vs, ſo that we are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger capable of it: and he hath alſo taken the gifte of nutrition from thy meate, that it ſhall not feede thee, and ſo thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for thy meate, and thy meate for thee.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſtill acknowledge this reply of Chriſt in this place; man ſhall not liue by bread only, but by euery word proceeding out of the mouth of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Bread, fleſh, and other prouiſion, would ſeeme but ſlender inſtruments to worke our health, and to nouriſh in vs, that life which God hath giuen vs.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they are common things, we make no myſterie of them: yet haue they matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment, if we weigh them aright. We could not liue, nor be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by ſuch weake meanes, if God had not giuen them a ſpeciall bleſſing to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our bodies.</p>
            <p>This, together with that which already hath bin ſpoken, proclaimes vnto vs, that man liueth not by bread onely; and for this cauſe do we vſe to ſanctifie our meates afore we receiue them, and after, which we
<pb facs="tcp:11763:59"/> call the ſaying of grace, wherein we pray God by thoſe his good gifts, our bodies may receiue ſtrength, and withal, to teach vs, that bread, without the woord cannot feede vs, for it is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
            <p>To draw towards an end, we learne two things by theſe words of Chriſt, he that hath faith ſhall taſte of two things.</p>
            <p>When he wantes ſuſtenance and is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, he ſhal be ſo ſtrengthned with the word of God, as if he had ſtuft himſelfe with the abundance of all delicates.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, whoſoeuer hath a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt confidence in god, ſhal not be left ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, but that God will vndoubtedly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all neceſſaries vnto him, as if he be pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with extremitie of hunger, rather than he ſhall periſh in his etremitie, God will giue him bread at length, though he muſt raine bread from heauen, as he did for the Iſraelites, when they liued in the deſart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place where no foode could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>Let euery Chriſtian man promiſe himſelf vndoubtedly theſe two thinges: for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceiued of his hope, eyther he ſhall haue ſufficient to eat, or his hunger ſhalbe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11763:59"/> ſo tolerable vnto him, that he may wel indure it, without fainting, for Gods word ſhall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine him.</p>
            <p>If thou be naked and haue nothing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee, rather than thou ſhalt periſh ſo, God will conuert the leaues falling from the trees, into coates, and clokes, for his children, he can as well do this, as cauſe the Iſraelites <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 4.</note> garments to continue freſh vpon them the ſpace of fortie yeares togither.</p>
            <p>Their clothes waxed not old, nor did their feet ſwel the ſpace of fourty yeares.</p>
            <p>It is ſpoken, and I do partly beleeue it, that there are not ſo manie ſheaues of corne, as there be people in the worlde: and it were not poſſible, I ſpeak after the maner of men, that there ſhould be bread enough to ſuffice ſo many, were it not ſo, that God doth dayly bleſſe, and increaſe the corne in the graine, and the meale in the dowe, and the bread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, yea and in the mouth too, when we eat, it: as was done by our Sanior Chriſt: and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> recordes it in the ſixteenth Chapter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, we ſee poore men and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in as good liking, and as wel to ſee to, though they fare hardly and ſcant, as the rich and their children, who glut themſelues with

               <hi>Firſt of their loue in folowing Chriſt.</hi>] The felicity of the godly is to ſticke to God, and to follow his will, and therefoee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, it is good for me to cleaue <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12 14</note> vnto the Lord. <hi>Samuel</hi> alſo perſwaded the Iſraelites, that they ſhould follow the Lord their God, and not depart from him.</p>
            <p>The children of God ought to carry ſo great an affection to God, as <hi>Eliſhah</hi> did to <hi>Eliah,</hi> who would not part from him, til the <note place="margin">2. King. 1</note> Lord diuided them.</p>
            <p>Such was the affection of the Apoſtles in this place, and at all times, they followed the lamb whither ſoeuer he went, to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to the deſart, to the ſea, and here to the ſhippe.</p>
            <p>This muſt teach vs to follow Chriſt both by ſea and land, in time of perſecution and elſe.</p>
            <p>For as the ſeparation of the ſoule from
<pb facs="tcp:11763:63"/> the bodie is the death of the body: ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Chriſt from the ſoule is the death of the ſoule: therefore we muſt folow Chriſt euen vnto the ſea.</p>
            <p>What multitudes of people are recorded <note place="margin">Luke. 5.</note> in the fift of <hi>Luke,</hi> they preſſed vpon him in ſuch ſort, that for feare of the throng, he was faine to enter into a ſhippe.</p>
            <p>The like throng of followers is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">2. Chr. 9. 7.</note> in the eight of <hi>Luke.</hi> If the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> could ſay, of <hi>Salomons</hi> followers, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thy men, and happy are theſe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants which ſtand alwaies before thee, and do heare thy wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Much rather may it be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, happy are Chriſts followers and his attendants, that ſtande euer in his preſence, like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to heare his heauenly wiſedome, ſince a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> is here, for this is he that taught <hi>Salomon</hi> his wiſedome.</p>
            <p>There is vertue in Chriſt, and it is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue vertue, to draw vs vnto himſelfe like a load-ſtone.</p>
            <p>He refuſeth no ſeruant, that will come to his ſeruice, let vs then be willing to offer our ſelues to ſerue ſo good a maiſter, for his burthen is light, and his yoake is eaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> He calles vpon vs for our good, Come to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11763:63"/> me all ye that are heauy loaden, and I wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you.</p>
            <p>Other maiſters vſe to load their ſeruants: but Chriſt is ſuch a maiſter, that takes the burthen from his ſeruants, and carries it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne ſhoulders to eaſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his brethren were glad to haue <note place="margin">Gen. 43. 21</note> corne for money, but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> returned them, both their corne and mony too.</p>
            <p>So if we will be the followers of Chriſt, &amp; ſerue him, wee ſhal find his ſeruice no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, for he will giue vs our freedome, and our wages too.</p>
            <p>In the eight of <hi>Luke,</hi> a certaine ſcribe <note place="margin">Luke. 8.</note> comes to Chriſt, and ſaith: maſter I will followe thee, whither ſoeuer thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</p>
            <p>Loe this ſcribe, who before he knew Chriſt, had a whole common wealth in his head, being a meere worldling, now began to leaue the world, and to caſt away his olde liuery, as the blind-man threw away his patched cloake in running to Chriſt, and betooke himſelfe to Chriſt his ſeruice.</p>
            <p>In the ninteenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> we find <hi>Zacheus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke. 19.</note> running to Chriſt, the world and <hi>Mammon</hi> did ſo hang vpon his backe till now, that he could not trauell to Chriſt: but now hauing
<pb facs="tcp:11763:64"/> come to the knowledge of Chriſt, and Gods ſpirit calling vpon him, he changeth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolutions, and ſhooke from him his <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 5</note> pillages, and his exactions, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did put from him his ſhooes, when the Angel called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him out of the flaming buſh, and now he was ſo light as <hi>Peter</hi> when his ſhakles fell from him, and he runnes to Chriſt haſtily, who receiued him ioyfully.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 10</note> In the tenth of <hi>Marke,</hi> one comes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Chriſt in like ſort, asking him what he might do to poſſeſſe eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 20</note> In the twenty of <hi>Mathew,</hi> two blind men, though they could not ſee Chriſt, yet they could follow him: and they gained that which they would not loſe againe for more <note place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All theſe are ſo many ſummons to cite vs before the conſiſtory of Chriſt, the blind, and lame, and diſeaſed, ſcribe, and publicane, ſicke, and whole, and all do call vpon vs to follow Chriſt like his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And behold, there aroſe, a great tempeſt in the ſea: and the ſhip was couered, &amp;c.</hi>] Now
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11763:64"/> we are to ſpeake of the accidents hapning in the great tempeſt but euen now Chriſt: and his Apoſtles had entered into the ſhippe, and loe a ſtorme ſo preuaileth, that the ſhip that carried them, is now couered with waues.</p>
            <p>Euen now it was calme, when the ſhippe ankered in the hauen, and no ſooner are the ſayles hoiſt, and they launcht into the deepe, but ſhip, and men, and all, are in ieopardie of drowning, ſee an vnexpected ſodaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
            <p>Here we may view the ſtate of Chriſts church militant: It is like the arke floating vpon the waters, like a lilly growing among the thrones, like the buſh that burnt and was not conſumed, like Chriſts ſhip in this place couered ouer with waues, and yet not ſunk: God ſuffereth his Saints to be oftentimes in danger, either to ſhew his power in their deliuerance, or to cauſe them by tribulation to come to him for ſuccour, and to make them the more thankfull.</p>
            <p>So he humbled the Iſraelites before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 5</note> and his Aegyptians.</p>
            <p>So he humbled <hi>Iacob</hi> all the time he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Laban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He humbled <hi>Iob</hi> in a greater meaſure, <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:11763:65"/> ſuffering Satan to diſcharge at him all his darts at once, thinking to make a full end of him.</p>
            <p>He humbled <hi>Heliah,</hi> in making him flie <note place="margin">1. Ki. 19.</note> from <hi>Iezabel,</hi> that ſought his life.</p>
            <p>How did he humble his owne Apoſtles, that were ſo deare vnto him, ſuffering them to be impriſoned, racked, whipped, ſtoned, <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> ſlaine with the ſword?</p>
            <p>Nay Chriſt his owne mother ſcaped not free: Simeon ſpeaketh that the ſword of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation <note place="margin">Luke. 2. 35</note> ſhould pearce her hart.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelfe entred not into his glorie, but being conſecrated through afflictions.</p>
            <p>The miracles that Chriſt wrought in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling others, did not ſo much moue the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as the miracle they felt in themſelues.</p>
            <p>Their faith had not ſuch exerciſe nor triall, in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing the blind recouer their ſight, the lame their limbs, the dumb their ſpeach, and the <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 8.</note> deaf their hearing, but now that the ſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them is in danger, and is violently toſſed, &amp; death is preſented before them, their faith begins to faint like <hi>Peter,</hi> and to looke about, like <hi>Iob</hi> for his patience, when he lay ſcraping himſelf vpon the dunghill.</p>
            <p>The ſtorme put them to a ſtagger, though Chriſt was in the ſhip with them.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:11763:65"/>
            <p>This ſtorme aroſe vpon their entring into a ſhip; this ſhip is a figure of the Church.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as thou arte receiued into the church and haſt giuen thy name to Chriſt, thou muſt looke for a ſtorme or a tempeſt.</p>
            <p>Satan wil neuer bend his mallice againſt thee till then.</p>
            <p>When we are running, and in the ready waye to Chriſt, then comes Satan, and layes ſtumbling blockes in our way, tempting vs with one baite or other, either with wantons <note place="margin">Iud. 16. Ioſuah. 7. Acts. 12. 23</note> as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he dalyed with <hi>Dalilah:</hi> or with couetouſnes, like <hi>Achan,</hi> and <hi>Gehezy,</hi> or with pride, like <hi>Nabucad-nezzar:</hi> or with ſelfe-loue, like <hi>Herod:</hi> or with enuy like <hi>Cain:</hi> and all to turne vs aſide quite out of the way from God, as he couſoned <hi>Adam</hi> out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</p>
            <p>If theſe baites do not preuaile, then he takes another courſe, (for Satan that ſuttle ſerpent hath more ſleights in his budget, then <hi>Dauid</hi> had ſtones in his ſhepheards <note place="margin">1.

            <pb facs="tcp:11763:66"/>
            <p>This of all the diuells darts is moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, euen his fiery dart of perſecution.</p>
            <p>There is a puniſhment executed by our magiſtracie vpon ſilent malefactors, which is called the preſſing to death, and it is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt tortures.</p>
            <p>And the diuell by his executioners exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth the ſame crueltie vpon Gods Saints: he hath his preſſing too, &amp; we are forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to arme our ſelues againſt that torment by our Sauior.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In mundo preſſuram ſuſtinebitis.</hi> If thou <note place="margin">Ioh. 16, 33</note> wilt not leaue thy way thou art in, nor break thy courſe in running to Chriſt; he will ſhew the vttermoſt of his malice againſt thee, and put thee to the racke, as he put <hi>Eſay</hi> to the ſaw.</p>
            <p>And this hath proued no ſmall rub in the alley, for it hath turned aſide many a forward runner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> a great while ranne well, but Satan <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 15</note> ſtopt him in his race, and made him ſwallow a ſiluer hooke, as he beguiled <hi>Eue</hi> with an apple; and ſo his end proued worſe than his beginning: he againe ſo frighted <hi>Demas,</hi> a great profeſſor a long time, with giuing <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4</note> him but a ſmall taſte of the cuppe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he forſooke his way, left Chriſt and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11763:66"/> his Apoſtles, and embraced this preſent world.</p>
            <p>He ſo preuailed with King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that thogh he gaue himſelf to heare <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, yet <hi>Paul</hi> left him but almoſt a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and could not make him a Chriſtian <note place="margin">Act. 27. 28</note> altogether: not to dwell in particulars, this Satan hath wraſtled mightily, euen with the elect veſſells of mercy, and with his ſtormes had quite ouerthrowne them, if Chriſt had not reſcued them, euen then when the fatall blow was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, like the angell that ſtayd <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 22</note> 
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand, when he would haue ſlaine his ſonne.</p>
            <p>How long did he chaine vp <hi>Paul</hi> making him his inſtrument to perſecute Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, till Chriſt drew him by violence to himſelfe, and afterwards he perſecuted Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and had him in the chaſe, as before Satan chaſed him?</p>
            <p>How ſtrong was Satan, and how weake was <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſeemed to be the ſtrongeſt of the Apoſtles, but ſhewed himſelfe in this combat the weakeſt, when he denied his maſter thriſe together?</p>
            <p>But though he receiued this foyle from the diuell, yet Chriſt raiſed him vp vpon his feete, from the downe fall of his ſinne, like
<pb facs="tcp:11763:67"/> 
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his graue.</p>
            <p>He ſtrooke at the roote, as well as the branches, and thought to haue diſrooted with his violent blaſts, the vine it ſelfe Chriſt Ieſus: he tempted him in the deſart: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Scribes and Pharaſies to tempt him: he made his owne Diſciple <hi>Peter</hi> to tempt him, when he would haue diſſwaded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going to leruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he tempted Iudas to betray him: he ſuborned fals witneſſes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemne him, being altogether innocent.</p>
            <p>But all this wrought Satans ouerthrow, for Chriſt by his death ouercame the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and triumphed like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when <note place="margin">

            <p>Here Chriſt ſeemeth to be forgetfull of his Diſciples, of the ſhippe, and of himſelfe: he ſlept, croſſing theſe ſcriptures, He that watcheth Iſrael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleepe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Why are ye fearefull O ye of little faith?</hi>]</p>
            <p>That which Chriſt commaunded the Rom. chapter fifteene, ſupport one another, is here practiſed by Chriſt himſelfe: he ſupporteth his diſciples and beareth with them, not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them off, but mildely reprehending them, why are yee fearefull, O yee of little faith? being Chriſts owne followers, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Chriſt with them, yet they could not be confident, and therefore they are well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued for their weakeneſſe, O ye of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith.</p>
            <p>As wee are not to bee too confident and ſtrong, like <hi>Peter,</hi> relying vppon his owne ſtrength too much, when he ſaide he would neuer forſake Chriſt, and yet was the firſt that ſhrunke from him: ſo let not vs be too weake, nor too fearefull, like the Diſciples here.</p>
            <p>Feare is the mother of diſtruſtfulneſſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> diſtruſted himſelfe, when he began to ſinke: and as <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; his companie were out of hope they ſhould be ſaued in that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous voiage, when the ſhip that carried them
<pb facs="tcp:11763:70"/> ſhiuered in peeces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O yee of little faith:</hi>] Here is the cauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why they were ſo weake, becauſe they wanted faith.</p>
            <p>If the diſciples had had but as much faith, as a graine of muſtard ſeede, they might be ſtrong enough to remoue mountaines: but they could not here remoue the ſtorme, their faith was ſo ſmall, no more than they coulde <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> heale the lunatick man in the ſeuenteenth of <hi>Mathew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the diſciples walked dayly with Chriſt: and ſaw his miracles, and the workes he did, yet they could not draw faith from him, as the woman drew vertue from him, though ſhe touched but his hemme.</p>
            <p>A little faith would haue qualified this <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 20.</note> great ſtorme, and haue pacified the waues, as a little oyle and a little meale could ſuffice the poore widow, and ſaue her from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in the dearth.</p>
            <p>Our ſinnes are in an Ephah, but our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">1. King. 17</note> are in a ſhekle: all our vertues are dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiues, they are all little ones like little Zoar A little wealth and a little pleaſure ſeemes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a little faith is inough, though it be neuer ſo ſmall a mite.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaith here, O ye of little faith: ſee our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11763:70"/> ſtature in religion is but ſhort and little, and we grow little and low like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that we cannot ſee Chriſt: but Chriſt wil haue vs to haue much faith, as hee biddes vs bring forth much fruit.</p>

            <p>It is written, aske and ye ſhall haue, knock and it ſhall be opened vnto you: here is that ſcripture fulfilled, the Apoſtles crie vnto Chriſt for ſuccour, and ſuccor is giuen them. The great ſtorme, how violent and raging ſoeuer, is here in a moment qualified, when Chriſt ariſeth and rebuketh it.</p>
            <p>All the ſtormes and troubles that happen to the godly, they are but an Interim, they are but of ſhort continuance, and then ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:11763:71"/> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> haue his children and goods againe: ſo Chriſt may ſleepe, but his prouidence euer awaketh, and preſerueth them that belong vnto him.</p>
            <p>Foule wether laſteth but a while; and then followeth a great calme, like the noyſe of <note place="margin">Roue. 14, 2.</note> harpers, after the ſound of thunders.</p>
            <p>Heauineſſe may indure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning, ioy is heere preſented in a moment to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Euen now the skie was full of clouds, and now the skie is cleere, and the cloudes vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and the calme is greater then the ſtorm.</p>
            <p>We may be in danger and trouble, when Chriſt ſleepeth, but when Chriſt awaketh &amp; ſeeth the waues ſowſing ouer our heads, and the water flaſhing into the ſhippe, he ariſeth and rebuketh the waues, as before he rebuked his Diſciples, and ſo the calme folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
            <p>The windes bluſtred, and the water vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſwelled, as long as Chriſt ſlept, as if they had bin priuie to his ſleeping, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as Chriſt awaked, and conſidered of the tempeſt, the windes, and waues conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues, and became quiet.</p>
            <p>Here is a full preſident of Gods mercy and of his power, he exerciſeth both for the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11763:71"/> good of his Diſciples, his wil appeares in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the waues, his power in ſuppreſſing the rage thereof.</p>
            <p>This made <hi>Tobit</hi> ſay thou ſcourgeſt, and <note place="margin">Tobi. 13, 2.</note> yet takeſt pittie: thou leadeſt to hel, and back againe.</p>
            <p>And Gods owne teſtimony proues the ſame, I kill, and I giue life: I wound, and I make whole, and in the ſixteenth chap. of Iohn, ſaith Chriſt; ye are in ſorrow nowe, but your hearts ſhall reioyce, and your ioye ſhall no man take from you.</p>
            <p>Let vs pray vnto God to increaſe our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith, and our ſhippe ſhal neuer miſcarrie.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue breefely ſeene the loue of the Apoſtles, in following Chriſt to the ſhippe: you haue alſo ſeene Satan tempting, the wether ſtorming the winds blowing, the Diſciples trembling, and Chriſt ſleeping, yet he being cried vnto, awaketh and ariſeth, and appeaſeth the rage of the ſea, and ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not his diſciples to periſh.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples loue towardes Chriſt, muſt arme vs with like affection, towardes him, and their want of faith muſt ſtirre vp our weakenes, and incredulity, and make vs flie to Chriſt, like the reſtleſſe doue to the arke.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11763:72"/>
            <p>So we ſhall be ſure to be ſafe amidſt all ſtormes, like his diſciples when Chriſt rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the windes.</p>

            <p>Of confeſſion of ſinnes, we haue many <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> preſidents in ſcripture, <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſſed the ſinnes of Iſrael. This people hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great ſinne.</p>

            <p>They that came to Chriſt, confeſſed their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Moſt notable is the confeſſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonne, out of which we may learne the manner of true confeſſion: firſt he did meditate with himſelfe, how he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinnes vnto his father, in that he ſaid: thus will I ſay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he cried out, I haue ſinned: he
<pb facs="tcp:11763:75"/> doth not excuſe himſelfe, nor hide his ſinne, like <hi>Adam</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt heauen: becauſe he eſteemed <note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> earthly things, more than heauenly things, and againſt thee: he looketh into the waight and greatneſſe of his ſinne, in offending ſo good a father, who had giuen him ſo liberall a portion.</p>

            <p>This auricular confeſſion came in about <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, and was not from Chriſt his time in the church, the hiſtory is to be read in <hi>Zozomenus</hi> 7. Booke Chap. 17.

            <p>Heere is the ſecond reaſon to induce vs to acknowledge our ſinnes, for God is iuſt.</p>
            <p>He is iuſt in his anger, and in his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: who ſhall ſtand, ſaith <hi>Nahum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of his wrathfull indignation?
<pb facs="tcp:11763:78"/> and his anger is poured out like fire, Pſ. 85. And againe, it is an horrible thing to fal into the hands of the liuing God. Heb. 12. Hee is iuſt to giue euery man according to his worke, Reue. 21. therefore confeſſe; for hee is iuſt. Hee hath promiſed free pardon, if thou performe this confeſſion: and of this pardon thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelfe, becauſe God is iuſt, and cannot breake with thee.</p>
            <p>To cleere this with many wordes, were to poynt at the ſhining ſunne, and to light a candle at noone daie: therefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to that which followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he may forgiue vs:</hi>] Though God be of power infinite, yet wil he not ſaue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without faith, forgiue ſinnes without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a principall branch of this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; is the confeſſing of ſinne. If thou trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the path of repentance thus far foorth, viz. to confeſſe thy ſins, and to bee aſhamed of them, and to be ſorie for them, yet if thou haue not faith, if thou beleeue not that God is faithful and iuſt to forgiue, thou commeſt ſhort of true repentance.</p>
            <p>For Iudas proceeded ſo farre as well as <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3. 4.</note> thou, yet he was damned, becauſe hee diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted God: he could not perſwade himſelfe that GOD would forgiue him, and ſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11763:78"/> he loſt that which the theefe found.</p>
            <p>Note therefore that three things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that ſinnes may be forgiuen.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Infuſio gratioe,</hi> the pouring of grace, or working of Gods grace in vs, as it wrought in <hi>Peter</hi> when he went to weepe.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, the remorſe of the ſoule, who fearing the danger of ſin, flies to god by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, like the publicanes &amp; ſouldiours in the 3. of Luke: to this belongs confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a change of mind, and caſting off old affections, by putting a new heart, like <hi>Saul,</hi> when a kingly ſpirit was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</p>
            <p>The calling of ſinners to repentance, is liuely deſcribed by the calling of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> in whoſe calling we are to note foure things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he was ſitting, noting the careleſſe ſecuritie of ſinners.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the place where he was, viz. the ſeate of cuſtome, noting how this worldlie Mammon doth draw men from God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee roſe vppe, ſhewing, when grace is poured into vs, then we riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin.</p>
            <p>It is not inough for vs to heare Chriſt cal, but we muſt riſe vp like <hi>Samuel,</hi> and S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> leauing our former ſtate &amp; occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, hee followed Chriſt: wee muſt not leaue ſinnes only before committed, but
<pb facs="tcp:11763:79"/> we muſt indeuour to leade a godly life euer afterwards, framing our ſelues to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding the inuincible truth of this doctrine, yet Satan, whoſe pollicie is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to hinder mans ſaluation, thought to draw men from the vnderſtanding hereof, and ſhuffled into mens heads diuers errors about remiſſion of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that not God alone, but man alſo may forgiue ſins: whence the ſelling of pardons, proceeded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that venial ſin may be forgiuen, with the infuſion of diuine, and heauenly grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly that there is no remiſſion, where there is not open confeſſion to the prieſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that remiſſion of ſinnes may be after this life, which opinion is defended by, <hi>magiſter ſententiarum:</hi> and this is the roote of Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>The Pellagians affirmed, that when ſinne is forgiuen, the puniſhment is alſo forgiuen, and therefore they ſay, the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, is not the reward of originall ſinne.</p>
            <p>And ſo they ſay <hi>Adam</hi> had died a bodily death, whether he had ſinned or not, but we know it to be otherwiſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This conſideration wee find to be firſt planted in God himſelfe, and ſecondarily from him deriued vnto men. It mooued God when hee did contemplate his owne glorie, for the further promoting thereof, to create the world, the heauens, and the earth, and the creatures therein, all to ſet foorth his glorie, according to that in the nineteenth Pſalme: The heauens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy workes, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>To preſſe a little neerer to the matter in hand, as the creating of the world, and after that, the creating of man doth ſhew the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious care and prouidence of God ouer vs: ſo in this place we find a freſh preſident of the Lordes like goodnes towards vs, noted in the words of my text. Alſo the Lord ſaid, it is not good that man ſhould be himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, I will make him a helpe.</p>
            <p>The words do offer theſe three things to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt the conſultation, or conference had betweene God and his wiſedome, for the creating of the woman.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11763:84"/>
            <p>Secondly, the effect of his conference, in the 21. verſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the maner of the womans creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in theſe wordes: God cauſed an heauie ſleepe to fal vpon the man.</p>
            <p>In this conſultation or conference, the loue of God, and his prouident care vnder mankind, is moſt liuely diſcouered. After he had made man the worlds wonder, and the moſt excellent of all his creatures, beeing but a little inferior to the Angels, and had made him Lord ouer the earth, &amp; all things in it contained, to gouerne the ſame by the diuine wiſedome, wherwith God had indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, hauing alſo placed him in Eden, that ſo glorious a ſeat, and ſo full of maieſtie, ſo plentifully ſtored with infinite varieties of rauiſhing pleaſures.</p>
            <p>For out of it made the Lord to growe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery tree pleaſant to the ſight, and good for meate, the tree of life alſo in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and euill: all this felicitie notwithſtanding, that <hi>Adam</hi> now poſſeſſed, and more might not ſeeme to be required for the bettering of his eſtate: for what can a man haue more, then the whole world to command, as <hi>Adam</hi> had, &amp; after him <hi>Noah?</hi> yet the Lord aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11763:84"/> in mercy, as he is all compounded of goodnes and mercy, ſaw ſome thing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> had not yet a companion, that might pertake with him in this his felicitie: al his ioy and pleaſure and ſolace ſeemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in regard of this one defect, he had none like himſelfe, that might conuerſe with him, or to whome hee might communicate theſe his ioyes.</p>
            <p>No man knew <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate but himſelf, which made the ſunſhine of his glorie, in ſome ſort eclipſed, yea, the vnreaſonable creatures, the beaſtes of the fields, the fiſhes in the waters, and the foules in the aire, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be in better caſe then <hi>Adam,</hi> for that they were not ſolitarie, euerie one being yoked with his like, beaſtes, foules, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes were multiplied in their kinde, but for <hi>Adam</hi> found he not an help meete for him.</p>
            <p>The wiſedome and learning of a man, which are the diuineſt parts in man, al theſe are nothing worth, if they be not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to others, what good iſſues from them if a man keepe them to himſelfe: if one be wiſe to himſelfe, learned to himſelfe, what profiteth it?</p>
            <p>No profit is in theſe, more than in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:11763:85"/> of them: for they lie dead within vs, not being drawne forth to the benefit of others, like fire that is hid in a flint-ſtone without heate, or perfume in a pomander without ſmell, except the one be ſtricken, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pounded.</p>
            <p>Man was borne for man, one man to help and ſupport another; and therefore moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely ſpake <hi>Tullie</hi> in this, though profanely in other matters: <hi>Non nobis ſolum nati ſumus: ſed partem patria vendicat, partem parentes, partem amici:</hi> God hath not giuen vs life, to the end we ſhould liue only to our ſelues, and be nothing helpefull to others: but our country doth challenge a part of vs, and our friends a part of vs, and our parents a part, and the leaſt part is our owne.

            <p>This huge frame of the world, whereof vnder me, he is the alone ſupreme Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would better content <hi>Adam,</hi> and the fruition of it would be reputed more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, and gladſome vnto him; if he might find a mate or companion to participate with him, in this his Angel-like life and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable happineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was yet alone in Paradiſe, and therfore the world and the creatures therein, the ayre, with the foules, the earth with the beaſts, trees, and hearbs; the ſea, and al waters, with the fiſh and whatſoeuer liueth therein, being all good: for the good God made all things good; and himſelfe hauing finiſhed the creation, ſurueyed all that he had made; and loe, it was exceeding good.</p>

            <p>Loe yet for all this, God, whoſe mercie is beyond meaſure, and whoſe goodnes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, exhibiteth to <hi>Adam</hi> further teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his loue, in drawing from his owne ſide a companion, when before hee was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie, for hee ſawe it was not good that hee ſhould be alone.</p>

And this much bee ſpoken of this firſt poynt of Gods conſultation or conference: nowe of his reſolution noted in theſe following wordes: <hi>I will make him an helpe meete for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hauing taken counſel with his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at length determineth for <hi>Adams</hi> good, an helpe meete from him: I ſhall not neede to vſe many woords, for the cleering of this note, for it containeth onely the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that which in the former woordes he interpleaded, and for the vſe of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, it is little differing from that which hath alreadie beene ſpoken, only it ſheweth the continuance of Gods mercie, and loue towards <hi>Adam,</hi> in performing ſo ſpeedilie what he before conſulted vppon. It is not good (ſaith the Lord) in the former parte of the verſe, that man ſhould be alone, and in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11763:97"/> the latter part he concludeth, I will make him a helpe meete for him.</p>
            <p>The reaſon that mooued the Lord to be ſo friendly vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> was this, becauſe it made for his good, it was profitable for him.</p>
            <p>And the ſame reaſon ſhould bee of force by the example of God, to inforce vs ſo to deale one with another: we ſhould imparte any thing to our neighbour that maketh for his good, if our friend want any thing that we can ſupplie, we ought not withhold it from him: for as the woman for the man, ſo men were made for men, one to helpe an other.</p>
            <p>God hath made all his creatures to ſerue man, the ſunne to ſhine, the ſtarres to giue light, the cloudes to water the grounde, the cattle to till the earth, and the earth to yeelde her increaſe, and all this for man: ſhall theſe dumbe creatures with ſuch voluntarie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſuch cheerefull alacritie, perform their duties in their neuer-failing miniſtrie, and ſhall not wee miniſter one to anothers neceſſitie? ſhall man onely, Gods owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and the perfection of all creatures, whom God made but a little inferior to the

            <p>See how peremptorilye the loue of God runnes, Is it good for man? I will do it.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhoulde carrye like loue one toward another, and wee ſhoulde learne to ſpeake as God ſpeaketh: Is it good for my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
            <p>I will doe it. His will and his loue did ioyne both togither, to further <hi>Adams</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines. His loue made the queſtion: Is it good? and his will preſently makes anſwere like <hi>Samuel</hi> at the firſt call; I will doe it for him.</p>
            <p>This was Gods loue towardes vs, O that ours towards him, were like his: for then as Gods loue procured Gods will, to woorke Adams good, ſo would our loue, beeing like his, draw forward our will, to execute in a carefull obedience, whatſoeuer God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth.

               <p>If ye loue the world, the loue of GOD dwelleth not in you: but when yee begin to loue the Lord in the ſinceritie of your harts, then, and neuer till then will the loue of the world fall from you with the vanities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the white ſcales fell fro Tobias eyes.</p>

               <p>Theſe two ſupport our faith as the twoo Lions. ſupported <hi>Solomons</hi> throne, and to what ſoule ſoeuer theſe two ſhall haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, euen thither ſhall obedience comc alſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe three are better welcome vnto God, than the three preſents offered by the

               <p>Theſe three graces, loue, feare, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, are like thoſe robes of righteouſnes to couer and beautifie the Saintes of God, which Saint Iohn extolleth with a threefold commendation; they were pure, fine, and ſhining.</p>
               <p>This loue holdes me to it. like an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and yet I may not part with it; till I haue planted it in you: for if I teache you this one leſſon, I teach you all, which is to loue God aboue all. We muſt loue him, for that he is mercifull in making vs, when wee were not, in protecting vs being made, but moſt of all, for ſauing vs, when we had loſt our ſelues, as Adam loſt himſelfe among the figge trees: for giuing vs the ayre to breathe with, the Sunne to giue vs light, the raine to fructifie the earth, the fire to warme vs, the beaſtes and foules and fiſhes to feede vs, all that is within, and without our bodies: This world, and the goodly frame thereof.</p>
               <p>This ought to make vs loue god, and in our loue to exclaime, like <hi>Dauid.</hi> O Lorde, what is man, that thou ſo gratiouſly viſiteſt him? but looking vpon our ſelues, and our ingratitude, that doe not loue god for all this: we haue cauſe to crie out vpon our ſelues, &amp;

               <p>This commaundement hath many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: it impeacheth the iudge, if hee giue falſe iudgement: it impeacheth the counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, if he carry himſelfe to his clyent other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he ought: it impleades the recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he falſifie the record, moſt of al it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes him, for the record being ſearched, if it be falſe, an hundred yeares after it may do harme: it reacheth to the iurors, if they giue not a true verdict, according to euidence: if theſe circumſtances were duly conſidered, there would be leſſe ſwearing and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring than commonly is vſed.</p>
               <p>To inſtruct you yet a little further in this commandement, you muſt note there bee three ſorts of teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suggeſti, Fori, Colloquij:</hi> of the Pulpit, of the Court, of Conference.</p>
               <p>Falſe witneſſe of the Pulpit is, when the peacher deliuereth falſe doctrine: if Chriſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11763:115"/> be not riſen, then is our preaching vaine, and <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15 14, 15 Acts 5.</note> we are counted falſe witneſſes of God.</p>
               <p>Falſe witneſſe-bearing in the Court, is when one man ſhall falſely accuſe an other before the iudge, as <hi>Tertullus</hi> accuſed <hi>Paul,</hi> calling him a peſtilent fellow, Act. 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or when the iudge himſelfe ſhall giue corrupt iudgement, as <hi>Pilat</hi> pronounced ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, thogh no crime could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt him.</p>
               <p>Teſtimony of conference is, when in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat matters one accuſeth another falſly, by way of ſlaunder.</p>
               <p>Alas if falſe witneſſe may be committed ſo many waies, who of vs is not a falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>We cannot certainely cleare our ſelues, from the breach of this commandement, no more than thoſe lewes could cleare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they accuſed the adulterous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt but told a lie, or haſt flattered, or haſt ſlaundered thy neighbour, thou haſt violated this commaundement: but how groſſely do they trangreſſe, and how hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous is their ſin, that in the face of a Court, in the ſight of God, of Angells, and of mens
<pb facs="tcp:11763:116"/> being produced to try the truth in matters of controuerſie, betweene neighbour and neighbour, will dare moſt groſſely, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religiouſly to ſweare an vntruth vppon their book-oathes</p>
               <p>Moſt daungerous and full of honour is the ſtate of ſuch a prophane wretch, for it is a ſinne in the next degree to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou but conſider what an oath were, and what a burden or clogge this is vnto thy conſcience, euen a more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous burthen to thy ſoule, than the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie of <hi>Naaman</hi> was vnto <hi>Gehezie,</hi> thou ſhouldſt bee better aduiſed in laying thine hand vpon a booke and bearing falſe witnes againſt thy neighbor: if after ſo many oaths thou haſt not yet learned what an oath is, learne it now, and bee aſhamed of thine ignoraunce, as <hi>Adam</hi> was of his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>Out of this definition may wee ſpell the ſubſtaunce of an oathe, and the daunger of it: if thou ſweare truely, thou haſt ſaued thy gage, ſaluation was the pledge or paine of thine oathes trial: but if thou ſweareſt falſely, thy pawne, &amp; thou thy ſelfe art forfeited, not vnto God, whom thou haſt denied, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his truth, but to him who is the father of lies, that tempted thee to lie againſt thine owne ſoule, as he tempted <hi>Ananiab</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> that is the diuell; and I know not how thou wilt be diſpenſed with.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou know then how to anoide the daunger heereof, and withall; the breach of this commaundement, thou muſt doe it thus: viz, in iudgement, in righteouſneſſe, and in trueth: and ſo I conclude this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>

               <p>See how carefull the Lord is ouer vs; he would haue vs, not onely to watch our woorkes, but our woordes alſo, and our thoughts.</p>
